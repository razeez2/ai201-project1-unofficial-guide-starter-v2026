Your test questions.

Milestone 2 asks you to write five questions your system should be able to
answer from your corpus, specific enough to have a right answer.

  ✗ "What are good dining halls?"          — no right answer
  ✓ "What do students say about wait times at Commons during lunch?"

Fill in `QUESTIONS` below. `expects` is a word or short phrase you'd expect a
correct answer to contain — you'll use it in unit 2 when you build a scorer,
and having written it now means you decided what "correct" meant before you saw
any results.

`OUT_OF_SCOPE` holds five questions your documents clearly don't cover. You
need these in Milestone 4 to find where your relevance cutoff belongs, and
again in unit 2, where `run_eval.py` runs them through the gate and writes what
happened into your run log — that's the evidence for criterion 3.

Swap them for your own if you like. Keep five of them either way: criterion 3
names a target of "4 of 5", and four of three is not a thing.
"""

# Each of these has one right answer sitting in one place in the corpus, and
# `expects` is the exact phrase that answer has to contain.
#
# The first three are deliberately the risky kind: Kestrel Commons has seven
# sibling dining halls and Morrow House seven sibling residence buildings,
# written to the same template with different numbers, so a wrong-building
# answer is the failure criterion 5 is watching for. Each `expects` here is a
# figure that appears in only one building's documents, so a plausible answer
# about the wrong building still scores as a miss. The last two are topics that
# exist in exactly one document, which is the failure criterion 1 is watching
# for.
QUESTIONS = [
    # {"question": "...", "expects": "..."},
    {"question": "How long is the wait at Kestrel Commons between 12:15 and 1:00?", "expects": "20 to 25 minutes"},
    {"question": "How much cheaper is Morrow House than the other housing tiers?", "expects": "$900"},
    {"question": "How many hours a week outside class should I expect for CS 210?", "expects": "8 to 10 hours"},
    {"question": "How late in the term can I declare a course pass/fail?", "expects": "week eight"},
    {"question": "When are the health centre's walk-in hours?", "expects": "8am to 11am"},
]

# Questions from a different world entirely. Your gate should refuse all five.
#
# There are five of these because criterion 3 in criteria.md names a target of
# "at least 4 of 5" — you need five things to try before you can report 4 of 5.
# `run_eval.py` runs these through retrieval and the gate on every eval and
# records what happened, so criterion 3 has evidence in the run log alongside
# the others. They cost no model calls: a refusal never reaches the model.
